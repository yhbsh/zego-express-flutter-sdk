  /// Use cases: After the developer collects the video data by himself or obtains the video data collected by the SDK, if the basic beauty and watermark functions of the SDK cannot meet the needs of the developer (for example, the beauty effect cannot meet the expectations), the ZegoEffects SDK can be used to perform the video Some special processing, such as beautifying, adding pendants, etc., this process is the pre-processing of custom video.
